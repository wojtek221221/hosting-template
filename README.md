# Free Website Project

Welcome to the Free Website Project! This is a simple, responsive website that I built some time ago and decided to share for free.

## About

This project was originally created to showcase basic front-end design principles.

While it was made a while ago, I decided to make it publicly available for anyone to use, adapt, or build upon. Feel free to explore, modify, or contribute!

## Features

- Simple, clean design
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Easy to customize
